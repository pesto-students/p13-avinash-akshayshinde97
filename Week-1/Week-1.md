## Assignment 1

### What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?

A Protocol is agreement between two layers(Application,Network, ect ref. OSI model) of a system/Application to transer data between them.
A protocol stack is an ordered list of protocols that are applied to data.
Let's understand in terms of a simple resquest (REST) over internet between client and server .

| Layer | Protocol |
| ------ | ------ |
| Application | HTTPS, TLS|
| Transport | TCP |
| Network | IP |
| Link | Wireless LAN  |

The above table illustrates the protocol stack . There can be many different examples where the protocol stack can be slightly different,
for sending email(Smtp) and  Sharing file(FTP)  over internet.


## What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?

Web servers are software applications or programs that handle HTTP requests from clients (web browsers or other devices) and serve web pages or other resources in response.
There are several types of open source web servers listed some very popular options below:-

- Apache
- Ngnix
- Caddy


## What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?

Web hosting is hosting your application on the web server so that it is accessible on the internet and anyone of the internet can use or app.
There are different types of Hosting services available:-
Here are some common types of web hosting:

-Shared Hosting: multiple websites are hosted on the same server and share its resources (CPU, RAM, etc.).
It is cost-effective and suitable for small websites with moderate traffic. However, since resources are shared, the performance might be affected if other sites on the server experience high traffic.

-VPS (Virtual Private Server) Hosting: VPS hosting divides a physical server into multiple virtual servers, each running its own operating system (OS).
Each VPS has dedicated resources, providing more control and better performance compared to shared hosting. It is suitable for websites that require more control and resources but don't need a dedicated server.

-Dedicated Hosting: Dedicated hosting provides an entire physical server dedicated solely to one website. It offers the highest level of control, performance, and security but comes at a higher cost.
Dedicated hosting is suitable for large websites with high traffic and resource-intensive applications.

-Cloud Hosting:Cloud hosting utilizes a network of interconnected servers to distribute resources and ensure high availability. It offers flexibility and scalability, allowing websites to use resources on-demand.
Cloud hosting is suitable for websites with fluctuating traffic levels and a need for scalability.

-Managed Hosting:
Managed hosting involves the hosting provider handling server maintenance, updates, security, and technical support. It's ideal for users who prefer to focus on their website content and leave server management to the experts.

Certain platforms which offer this type of Hosting services are Hostinger,Digital Ocean,AWS,AZURE.



## What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

Scaling a hosted app/service/system means increasing it's capabilites to serve the request coming from clients.
It is very important to build a scalable system/Service/App in today's day and age because to make sure our service is avialable,
and working properly we need to scale our service/application.
There are majorly two ways to scale a service:-

-Horizontal scaling:- In this we replicate the servers(cab be web server, email server, file server etc) into
multiple available instances, so that the sudden/increased load can be distributed among them and they all can manage the request coming from clients.

-Vertical Scaling:- In this we increase the power/computation capablities of the single/Multiple server like we can upgrade to better perfroming
cpu or increase the ram of the server and also increase the storage of the server.

Ther can be scenarios where our application/service need to be scalled Horizontally and vertically.


## What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and how can web developers optimize their websites for better search engine rankings?

Search Engine Optimization is the practice of optimizing websites to improve their visibility and ranking on search engine results pages. The goal of SEO is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to a website by making it more relevant and valuable to search engine users.

As a web devloper we can do the following things:-


1. On-Page Optimization: Optimize on-page elements such as title tags, meta descriptions, header tags (H1, H2, etc.), and URL structures. Incorporate target keywords naturally into these elements.

2. Mobile-Friendly Design: Ensure the website is responsive and mobile-friendly as more users are accessing websites on mobile devices.

3. Page Speed Optimization: Optimize website loading speed by compressing images, leveraging browser caching, and using a content delivery network (CDN) to deliver content faster to users.

4. URL Structure: Use descriptive and SEO-friendly URLs that include relevant keywords and accurately reflect the page's content.

5. Internal Linking: Create a logical internal S structure to help search engines understand the website's hierarchy and to distribute link authority across various pages, having site map helps.

6. External Link Building: Encourage natural backlinks from authoritative and relevant websites.

7. Image Optimization: Use descriptive alt tags for images to improve accessibility and help search engines understand the image content.

8. Secure Website: Implement HTTPS to provide a secure browsing experience for users. Google considers HTTPS as a ranking signal.
